#   7.5inch HD e-Paper HAT (B) 880x528 driver
Micropython driver for e_ink display "Waveshare 7.5inch HD e-Paper HAT (B) 880x528".  
I usually took drivers for electronic paper here https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-waveshare-epaper , but this time the driver I needed was not there. I had to do it myself. Perhaps this will save you time.
